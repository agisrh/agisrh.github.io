A logistics system that collaborates to ensure the smooth flow of goods from the point of origin to the end consumer. Agents can handle specific tasks at the local level, hubs facilitate the efficient transfer of goods, and couriers ensure the final delivery. Real-time reporting and tracking systems are implemented to monitor the movement of goods and optimize the entire logistics process.
